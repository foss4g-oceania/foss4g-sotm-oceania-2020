## Call for Presentations
Transform your research, ideas, and best practices into a presentation at the FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2020 Conference. Spark the imagination and encourage dialogue on the topic of your choosing.

We want you to share your fascinating stories about open source geospatial, open data, and open street map in Oceania. We're looking for a diverse range of presenters including: women, people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, young and old, urban and rural. To achieve this goal we need you to accept the challenge and put yourself forward, the community can't wait to hear what you have to say!

For this year's conference, the scheduling of each presentation will be managed by each Hub Manager. It is also a hybrid online/in-person event, with hubs being organised in cities across the region, from Perth in the west to Rarotonga in the east, and many places in between. 

* Apia, Samoa
* Auckland, New Zealand
* Bairiki, Kiribati
* Cairns, Australia
* Canberra, Australia
* Christchurch, New Zealand
* Hobart, Australia
* Melbourne, Australia
* Perth, Australia 
* Rarotonga, Cook Islands
* Suva, Fiji

### The conference has two components

* A broadcast of keynote presentations from across the region, bringing the brightest and most thought-provoking ideas to your screen. If you wish to be part of this component you can indicate it in the form linked below and the committee will contact you if your presentation has been chosen. We only have a two hour window for this part, so submissions will be vetted before finalizing the list of presenters.  
* An in-person local hub with presentations by people near you, and the opportunity to gather with old friends and meet new geospatial practitioners from your area. If you choose to present at a local hub, indicate that in the form linked below too and either the local Hub Manager or a rep from the organizing committee will contact you if your presentation is part of this component.

Follow the link below to submit your name and presentation details.

Closing date for applications is 14th October, 2020.
