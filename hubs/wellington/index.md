Who’ll be there?

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

This is your chance to connect with and hear from developers creating the next generation of geospatial technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what’s on the horizon. FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract a very diverse audience on the global stage – so strap in for amazing content.

We’re monitoring the COVID situation closely and will make sure the conference is a safe and clean space in line with the latest guidance.

The number of tickets is limited by the size of the room and social-distancing guidelines.
