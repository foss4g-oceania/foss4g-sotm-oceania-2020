    <h4 id="rod-nowrojee-keynote-presentation">Rod Nowrojee - Department of Fire and Emergency Services</h4>

    <p><b>Title:</b> Open Data, Open Observations</p>

    <p>
        <!-- <b>Biography:</b> -->Rod has seen spatial information at work from several perspectives working within
        multiple
        State and Commonwealth agencies. Within each of these agencies he has held roles which integrated data and data
        process into regulatory approvals; policy and operations. At its core, this has meant integrating information
        from science, industry and public sector.<br /><br />

        Rod has worked with data representing conservation, infrastructure, mining, urban planning, land management and
        emergency response. In 2008 Rod received the WA and Asia Pacific Spatial Information award for his work on the
        Western Australian State of the Environment Report; and in 2011 he co-ordinated a Ministerial taskforce on
        collaborative public/industry data collection in environmental approvals (Shared Environmental Approval
        Knowledge - SEAK).

        He is currently immersed in the complexity of emergency management and response.</p>

    <h4 id="ross-gillis-community-presentation">Ross Gillis - Hydrobiology</h4>

    <p><b>Title:</b> Open source remote sensing and dashboarding – surface water monitoring at your fingertips</p>

    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Monitoring seasonal variation in Western Australia’s surface water (e.g. lakes, ponds, dams etc)
        is essential for water management, aquatic ecology and biodiversity, regulatory compliance, public amenity, and
        water resourcing for bush fire-fighting. Hydrobiology have developed a workflow to extract, wrangle, process,
        analyse and interpret patterns in surface water as it grows and shrinks seasonally.<br /><br />Our process
        utilizes freely available satellite imagery (Sentinel-2), geospatial analysis in R and dashboarding in RShiny to
        create a simple end product for clients to understand, interact and ultimately make decisions towards better
        water management.</p>

    <h4 id="james-keating-lightning-talk">James Keating - Hydrobiology</h4>

    <p><b>Title:</b> Into the deep – Hydrographic surveying using open source applications</p>

    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Aquatic ecological investigations require a strong understanding of the entire water body, from
        top to bottom. Typical examples include habitat classification of the seabed, old infrastructure abandoned at
        the bottom of a flooded mine pit, or the morphology of a river.
        < br />
        < br />Commercially available hydrographic instruments and software are often cost prohibitive in conducting
        such surveys. We present a concept for a hydrographic workflow that incorporates affordable off - the -
        shelf side scan sonar, low cost DIY tow - fish(think mini - torpedo) and Python based image analysis in
        a QGIS plugin to automate the processing of sonar imagery into a cohesive story. We take a case study
        from a project we conducted in South America to identify abandoned mining infrastructure in a flooded
        mine pit.</p>
