## FOSS4G SotM Oceania - may sound complicated. So here is what it means

'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' or FOSS4G if you are a fan of efficiency (we are) is the name given to the conferences of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). OSGeo is a non-profit organisation with a mission to foster and promote the adoption of open source geospatial technology. All of this is done within the broader context of open source software philosophy and participatory community driven development.

'State of the Map' or SotM is the conference of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) which supports the development of a free and open editable world map. This takes the form of the community driven OpenStreetMap project.

## Attend

### What can I expect

FOSS4G SotM Oceania belongs to you! It's the chance to come together as a community to share knowledge and experience through conference sessions, technical workshops, and social events. The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community mappers and government.

### Where is it

The Hobart Hub will be at MRT, 30 Gordons Hill Rd, Rosny Park, Tasmania, Australia 7018.

### Who is going to be there

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

This is your chance to connect with and hear from developers creating the next generation of geospatial technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what's on the horizon. FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract a very diverse audience on the global stage – so get ready for amazing content.

### Why should I go

You will learn about cutting edge technologies and what is on the horizon, meet the experts and talk to them and learn new skills. You will have the chance to hear what others like yourself are doing and producing with their open source geospatial tools. Along the way you will meet up with old friends, make new ones and share your experiences.

### COVID safety

We are monitoring the COVID situation closely and will make sure the conference is a safe and clean space in line with the latest guidance.
