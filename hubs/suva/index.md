# Overview

The much awaited FOSS4G Oceania Conference is coming to Fiji as a hybrid conference event. At the Fiji Hub,
    we are excited to open the doors to you and share the power of open source geospatial technology and data. 
    Your local hub managers are excited to bring the best, the interesting and those who dare to make a difference 
    using the powers of open source right here at the USP-Japan ICT Auditorium on the 20th of November. Due to current

### FOSS4G SotM Oceania - Yeah, we know that's a mouthful. Here's what it means.

So let's break it down — 'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' or FOSS4G if you're a fan of
    efficiency (we are) is the name given to the conferences of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).
    OSGeo is a non-profit with a mission to foster and promote the adoption of open source geospatial
    technology. All of this is done within the broader context of open source software philosophy and
    participatory community driven development.
    
'State of the Map' or SotM is the conference of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) which supports the
    development of a free and open editable world map. This takes the form of the community driven OpenStreetMap
    project.
    
### What can I expect?
FOSS4G SotM Oceania belongs to you! It's the chance to come together as a community to share
    knowledge and experience through conference sessions and social events.
    The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community
    mappers, and government.
    
### Who's gonna be there?
This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers,
    academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap
    project.
This is your chance to connect with and hear from developers creating the next generation of geospatial
    technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what's on the horizon. FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract
    a very diverse audience on the global stage – so strap in for amazing content.
    
### Why should I go?
You'll learn about cutting edge tech and what's on the horizon, meet the experts and talk to them, and learn new
    skills. Get the chance to hear what others like yourself are doing and producing with their open source
    geospatial tools. Along the way you'll meet up with old friends, make new ones, and share your experiences.
    
### COVID safety
<p>We're monitoring the COVID situation closely and will make sure the conference is a safe and clean space in line
    with the latest guidance.</p>
